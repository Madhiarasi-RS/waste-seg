## BinthereRecycleThat

BinthereRecycleThat is a tool that helps individuals dispose of their waste properly by providing real-time data on whether an item is recyclable or not. The project was inspired by the fact that the average recycling contamination rate is **25%**, which costs the industry **up to $500 million annually.** Many individuals want to be environmentally aware, but do not know the recyclable nature of items. BinthereRecycleThat aims to solve this problem by providing a __simple, convenient, and effective solution.__

# How It Works

BinthereRecycleThat allows users to scan items with their device's camera, which then provides real-time data on whether the item is recyclable or not. Users can also install a camera at the top of their trash can to get immediate guidance on how to dispose of the item they're currently holding. The tool also tracks what objects users are using/throwing away the most, and what objects they are buying the most, which allows us to recommend users products based on their usage of certain items.

# Features

BinthereRecycleThat has several features that make it a convenient and effective tool for individuals and companies alike:

1. Scan and go functionality that allows users to get immediate guidance on how to dispose of an item.
2. Specific login functionality for different users, which allows us to track what objects users are using/throwing away the most, and what objects they are buying the most.
3. Pro and con prompts that encourage users to properly dispose of their waste.
4. A page with similar products related to the product just being disposed of, which allows us to recommend users products based on their usage of certain items.
5. Collaboration with brands as part of their Social Responsibility Program to offer discounts to users who donate the most, while allowing the brands to sponsor and advertise their products on this page.
6. A news page where users can get personalized news articles based on the items they throw away, which keeps users informed and engaged in recycling.
